        <p>
            <li>In contrast to their single-page counterparts, multi-page websites consist of several pages under a single domain, each dedicated to a different aspect of the business or topic. This standard website structure allows for a more extensive and detailed presentation of content, with a clear hierarchy and navigation system. </li>
            <li>For instance, an e-commerce website will typically use a multi-page website to separate product categories, provide detailed product pages, offer an about us section and host a blog. This separation helps users find specific information quickly and efficiently.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginLeft:'300px', color:'yellow',fontSize:'larger'}}>Advantages of multi-page websites</p>
        <p>Multi-page websites are the go-to structure for many businesses due to their ability to handle complex information and provide a detailed user experience. Here are some of the advantages they offer:</p>
        <p>
            <li>Improved SEO opportunities: With multiple pages, you have more opportunities to target a variety of keywords, which can improve your site's visibility in search engine results.</li>
            <li>Scalability: As your business grows, so can your website. Adding new products, services, or content sections is straightforward with a multi-page design.</li>
            <li>Content organization: A multi-page layout allows for better organization of content into categories and subcategories, making it easier for website users to navigate and find what they're looking for.</li>
